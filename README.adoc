== 📌 Overview

This project implements an end-to-end Computer Vision pipeline for binary image classification (Cat vs Dog) using deep learning.

The system includes:

- Model training with PyTorch (ResNet18)
- Validation and performance evaluation
- FastAPI inference service
- Docker containerization
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Automated build and deployment pipeline

Validation Accuracy achieved: *96.31%*
